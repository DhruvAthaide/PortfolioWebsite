# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It's a modern, single-page application built with React and TypeScript, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background as a Cybersecurity Programmer and Red Team Analyst.

The website features an interactive 3D particle background, smooth page transitions, and a clean, responsive design that works across all devices.

## ✨ Features

*   **Interactive 3D Background**: An animated particle field built with `react-three-fiber` that responds to mouse movement.
*   **Responsive Design**: A fully responsive layout built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a great user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
*   **Dark/Light Mode**: A theme toggler that respects user's system preference and saves their choice in `localStorage`.
*   **Smooth Animations**: Seamless page transitions and component animations powered by `framer-motion`.
*   **Dynamic Content**: Project, skill, and experience data is managed centrally, making updates easy.
*   **Functional Contact Form**: An integrated contact form using `EmailJS` to send messages directly to my inbox.
